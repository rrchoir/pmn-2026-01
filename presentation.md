# How we've scaled

* Song leaders
* Colorful vests
* Effective use of Signal + Email + Web

---

# Song leaders

* No one person has to lead all the songs
* A choral quorum (6) means you have backup
* Practices are as much about song leading as singing

---

# Colorful vests

* A sense of solidarity boost courage
* Event organizers use us as visual theme
* Safety (pack in/pack out)
* Lends authority

---

# Signal - Timeline

* A song leader pitches the idea
* After :thumbs-up: x 3, a new channel
* Email sent out to amplify 
  * Web page with song list & links
  * Usually we print song sheets too
* Signal group focusses chatter for event

# Outcomes

* Avelo is ceasing DHS flights
* We've reclaimed one parking lot from ICE
