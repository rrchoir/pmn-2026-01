# Rapid Response Choir

## Vision and Mission

The Rapid Response Choir sings for truth, justice, and democracy – we stand against threats to the Constitution and our community....

When authoritarian forces seek to harm our neighbors and community, the Rapid Response Choir will be there to sing truth to power.

^
The literal vision for the RRC came to me on Sunday morning, 
Jan 26, 2025. I was serving as Door Guardian for a majority immigrant 
church, with my cheat sheet for how to respond should "La Migra" show up. 
In putting together our Door Guardian practices, we knew eventually we should build
out a rapid response network of: witnesses, political actors, & media.

^
As I sat through service in the lobby, I mused on the notion of "Rapid 
Response", and I had a vision of am impassioned choir from the local 
churches marching down singing upon the ICE agents, calling them 
to task, and supporting our beleaguered neighbors. Wouldn't it be amazing,
I pondered, if we had a Rapid Response Choir. Which would:

# Rapid Response Choir - 2025

* First practice on February 4
* First public appearance March 4
* 40 subsequent events in 2025
* One event _per day_ in 2026 (through 1/13)
* Four chapters (DC, Baltimore, N. Virginia, Massachusetts)

^
So the RRC was born. I took that idea, published a Google Doc, and
announced it at College Park Chorale practice on groundhog Day "Hey - what the world needs is rapid
response choir! If you're game, see me at break. About 1/5th of the choir 
were in for this.

^We started practicing in my basement, working from YouTube, doing outreach,
getting a domain and website and mailing list, ordering 
pink vests and by March we were raring to go.

^I worked some contacts with a local climate action network, and offered to provide song leading for a rally to support NOAA scientist (just down the road from us) and from there we've grown to... Supporting 40 events in 2025, to 13 events in the first 2 two weeks of 2026! We have chapters in NE DC, N. Virginia, Baltimore, and central Massachusetts.

Here we are in action on Oct 18 @ No Kings Two:

# How we've scaled

* Song leaders
* Colorful vests
* Effective use of Signal + Email + Web

^
Now, not all our events have the same lead time. They've been as 
small as 5 of us for elementary school, to fund raisers, to court hearings
to solidarity events for the transgender community. Sometimes we're invited,
sometimes we just show up early, start singing, and see how we can help 
the event organizers.

^I'm not at most events. We've leaned on training up song leaders,
making a visual and musical impact, and using modern tools for organizing.

---

# Song leaders

* No one person has to lead all the songs
* Practices are as much about song leading as singing
* We find safe places for novice song leader
* A choral quorum (6) means you have backup

---

# Colorful vests

* Boosts courage
* Enhances Safety (pack in/pack out)
* Provides a visual element for organizers
* Lends authority

^Image - Me and the first vest

^Unlike Tshirts, easy to don, and doff
We're provided a backdrop for press conference
Makes it a lot easier to get the attention of an event coordinator,
eg. at the Venezuela protets.

# How we use web/mail/Signal

* Web site - public
  * Songs / Events + QR code / Chapters (coming soon)
* Mailing list - restricted
* Signal groups - vetted
  * Song leaders group
  * Entire choir (noisy!)
  * Event-specific

---

# How an event unfolds

* Signal: A song leader pitches the idea
* After :thumbs-up: x 3, a new channel
* Email sent out to amplify
* Web page with a song list
* Coordination on event-specific Signal
* Muster 30-40 minutes early and: Sing!

^
* Lots of people to help with:
  * formatting, printing song sheets
  * off site safety coordinators
  * and more...
So... We've and others have done all these events, what
good has come of it?

# Kilmar

* March: "Mistakenly" detained and deported to CECOT
* April 4: Federal court hearing - coordinate w/ CASA and CAN
  * Response from the family
  * Press coverage
  * Continued protest
  * Political attention and ... change

^Political actors like Sen. Chris Van Hollen got involved
because they sensed a political opportunity that would not
have appealed to them had the community sat on their hands

^People kept coming back because the protests were hopeful
and uplifting instead of just strident and angry

^The family felt supported: We heard from CASA staff that
Jennifer, his wife, and other family members felt blessed 
and relieved that, expecting shouts and anger, they were greeting 
with singing and centering: Paz, queremos paz, y libertad, 
en este mundo.

^So we kept showing up, hearing after hearing, rain & heat, and
now Kilmar is home his family.

# Right wing media _loathes_ us

* This is a good thing
* They don't know how to respond

# De-escalation example #2

* Vignette from NoVa

# Growing to meet the challenge

* 3.5% of the population 
  * = 9.1 million
* If 1:500 of those people sing
  * = 45,000 singers
  * (or 9,100 if 1:1000 ratio)

That's a lot of pink vests :smile:
