# Rapid Response Choir - 2025

* Groundhog Day 2025
* First public appearance March 4
* 40 subsequent events in 2025
* One event _per day_ in 2026 (through 1/12)
  * 3 (or 4) chapters

^
Events: 
- ranging from 5 of us singing at elementary school, to 40 of us at NK2
- sometimes we sing on the outskirts
- or we don't have a role, sing early, invite organizers to include us
- here's an example from Oct 18 @ No Kings Two:

# How we've scaled

* Song leaders
* Colorful vests
* Effective use of Signal + Email + Web

---

# Song leaders

* No one person has to lead all the songs
* A choral quorum (6) means you have backup
* Practices are as much about song leading as singing

---

# Colorful vests

* A sense of solidarity boost courage
* Event organizers use us as visual theme
* Safety (pack in/pack out)
* Lends authority

---

# Event Timeline - 

* A song leader pitches the idea
* After :thumbs-up: x 3, a new channel
* Email sent out to amplify
* Signal group focusses chatter for event
* Web page with a song list takes ~2 minutes
* Lots of people to help with:
  * formatting, printing song sheets
  * off site safety coordinators
  * and more...

# Outcomes

* Kilmar Ábrego García is home
  * https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ny7yl097o
* Avelo is ceasing DHS flights
* We (DCLC et al.) reclaimed one parking lot from ICE
* And shuttered Target during small-biz Saturday

# Right wing media _loathes_ us

* This is a good thing
* They don't know how to respond

# But first, a song

... america the beautiful ...

# Why?

* 3.5% of the population 
  * = 9.1 million
* If 1:500 of those people sing
  * = 45,000 singers
  * (or 9,100 if 1:1000 ratio)

That's a lot of pink vests :smile:
